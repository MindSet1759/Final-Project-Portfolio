            <p>
                 I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user <br>interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite <br>work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences <br>that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.
                 <br>
                 <br>Currently, I'm a Front-End Engineering student at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/vephlauni/">Vephla University</a> , learning to<br> specialize in accessibility and contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI <br>components that power frontend engineering, ensuring that platforms meet web<br> accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.
                 <br>
                 <br>In the past, I've had the opportunity to learn software development across a variety<br> of settings — from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small<br>  digital product studios. Additionally, I have also watched  comprehensive video courses<br> a few years ago, learning how to build a web app with the Spotify API.
                 <br>
                 <br>In my spare time, I’m usually climbing, playing tennis, hanging out with my wife and two<br> kids, or running around London searching for fashion pieces.

                                        I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems and create new opportunities. Growing up, I spent a lot of time tinkering with computers and learning how to code, which sparked my interest in software development. Additionally, I was inspired by the idea of being able to create something from scratch and see it come to life on the screen. The ability to build applications that can impact people's lives and make a difference in the world is what truly motivated me to pursue a career in development.

                                        Staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development is crucial in this ever-evolving field. I make it a priority to regularly read industry blogs, follow influential developers on social media, and participate in online communities such as Stack Overflow and GitHub. Additionally, I attend webinars, conferences, and workshops whenever possible to learn from experts and network with other professionals. I also take online courses and tutorials to deepen my understanding of new tools and frameworks. By dedicating time to continuous learning and staying engaged with the developer community, I ensure that I remain current with the latest advancements in web development.

                                        One of the most challenging projects I've worked on was developing a complex web application for a client with very specific requirements and a tight deadline. The project involved integrating multiple third-party APIs, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and implementing advanced features such as real-time data updates and user authentication. To overcome these obstacles, I first broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and created a detailed project plan with milestones and deadlines. I also collaborated closely with the client to ensure that their expectations were aligned with the project's progress. When faced with technical challenges, I conducted thorough research, sought advice from colleagues, and experimented with different solutions until I found the best approach. Through effective time management, clear communication, and a problem-solving mindset, I was able to successfully deliver the project on time and meet the client's requirements.

                                        My advice to someone starting their career in web development would be to focus on building a strong foundation in the core technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's important to understand the fundamentals before diving into frameworks and libraries. Additionally, I would recommend working on personal projects to apply what you've learned and build a portfolio that showcases your skills. Don't be afraid to ask questions and seek help from the developer community, as collaboration and learning from others are key aspects of growth in this field. Lastly, stay curious and keep learning, as web development is constantly evolving, and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies will help you stay competitive in the industry.
